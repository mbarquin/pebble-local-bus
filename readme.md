Introduction
------------
This app is intended to track local bus times in vigo. Local company has a private API to query about bus stops timetables, but this app doesn't use it. There is a private API which parses some public timetables from another web system and return its values to the pebble app. I have hardcoded some identifiers of my favorite stops, and it has also an index with all stops in Vigo ordered alphabetically. With this data I can track any bus stop times with my pebble, if some bus is coming in the next 2 minutes, the pebble will vibrate and show this entry in red.. I post some pictures of it.
